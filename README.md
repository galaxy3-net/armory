# armory
Prior to the Great Sith War, a Sith armory, which included dark side lore, was discovered in the jungles of Onderon.[1] During the Clone Wars, the Tipoca City Military Complex on Kamino house several weapon armories[2] as well as the Central Armory, where where clone troopers received their armor.[3] During the First Battle of Kamino, Confederacy of Independent Systems forces overran the area. Following the devastation wrought by the Clone Wars, an initiative was begun by the inhabitants of Alderaan to disarm themselves and devote their world to peace.[4] The Alderaanian War Frigate Another Chance was converted into a mobile armory and programmed to make random hyperspace jumps across the galaxy.[5]
